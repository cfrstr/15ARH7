8FC0DE0C-B4E4-43FD-B0F3-8871711C1294 is unknown to the kernel, a driver may need
to be implemented for this GUID.
A WMI driver probably needs to be written for this WMI event. It can checked for
using: wmi_has_guid("8FC0DE0C-B4E4-43FD-B0F3-8871711C1294"). One can install a
notify handler using
wmi_install_notify_handler("8FC0DE0C-B4E4-43FD-B0F3-8871711C1294", handler,
NULL). http://lwn.net/Articles/391230 describes how to write an appropriate
driver.
